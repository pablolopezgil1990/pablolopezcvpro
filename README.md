# Pablo López Gil · CV

This repository contains a small React + Vite + Tailwind project that serves as a mobile-friendly CV for Pablo López Gil.

   cd pablolopezcv

Notes

- The app uses Tailwind CSS and expects the CV PDF to be available at `/pablo-lopez-gil-cv.pdf`. Add the PDF file to the `public/` folder or the project root and it will be served at that path.
